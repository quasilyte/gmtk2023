Comments:

* Scout is the cheapest and fastest to build body
* Fighter is a solid body for a frontline combat unit
* Hunter is like fighter, but much faster and more expensive
* Destroyer is a very durable body that can survive several lancer hits, it's very slow

Comments:

* Scatter Cannon is a way to handle large groups of light vehicles
* Light Cannon is an universal unit for the frontline; the fastest to produce
* Heavy Cannon is a moving fortress that can take a lot of danage
* Assault Laser can be used as a cheap missile launchers killer
* Tank Buster is a counter against heavy tanks if missiles are out of question (due to flaks)
* Hurricane is a missile approach against large groups of light vehicles
* Lancer is the best anti-tank unit, unless enemies have flaks to negate that
* Flak is needed to protect your units against enemy missles; it's weak otherwise
